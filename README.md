# 100 Days · 100 ML Projects

A personal challenge to learn Machine Learning from **absolute zero** by building **one small project every day** for 100 days.

No hype.  
No shortcuts.  
Just fundamentals → practice → consistency.

## 📌 What this repo contains
- 100 small, focused ML projects  
- Gradual progression (math → models → real-world ML)  
- Emphasis on **understanding**, not just accuracy  
- Clean, reproducible code  

Each day lives in its own folder.
